# NoteHub

NoteHub is a simple web-based note-taking application.

- Notes are stored in your browser's localStorage (no server, no account required).
- Notes are organized in a tabbed (multi-tab) interfaceâ€”each tab is a separate note.
- You can import and export your notes as JSON files for backup or transfer.
- The app is lightweight and runs entirely in your browser.

Just open the page and start taking notes!
